  /**
   * @ingroup thermoprops
   *
   *  This is a filter class for ThermoPhase that implements some prepatory
   *  steps for efficiently handling
   *  a variable pressure standard state for species.
   *
   *  Several concepts are introduced. The first concept is there are temporary
   *  variables for holding the species standard state values 
   *  of Cp, H, S, G, and V at the
   *  last temperature and pressure called. These functions are not recalculated
   *  if a new call is made using the previous temperature and pressure.
   *
   *  There are also temporary
   *  variables for holding the species reference-state values of Cp, H, S, and G at the
   *  last temperature and reference pressure called. These functions are not recalculated
   *  if a new call is made using the previous temperature. 
   *
   *  To support the above functionality, pressure and temperature variables,
   *  m_plast and m_tlast, are kept which store the last pressure and temperature
   *  used in the evaluation of standard state properties. An optional utility is provided
   *  to store the results from the last temperature and pressure standard
   *  state calculation and use it on subsequent calculations, if the temperature
   *  and pressure are unchanged.
   *
   *  If #m_useTmpRefStateStorage is set to true, then the following internal
   *  arrays, containing information about the reference arrays,
   *  are calculated and kept up to date at every call.
   *
   *  - #m_h0_RT
   *  - #m_g0_RT
   *  - #m_s0_R
   *  - #m_cp0_R
   * 
   *  The virtual function #_updateRefStateThermo() is supplied to do this
   *  and may be reimplemented in child routines. A default implementation
   *  based on the speciesThermo class is supplied in this base class.
   *  #_updateStandardStateThermo() is called whenever a reference state
   *   property is needed.
   *
   *  When  #m_useTmpStandardStateStorage is true, then the following
   *  internal arrays, containing information on the standard state properties
   *  are calculated and kept up to date. 
   *
   *  -  #m_hss_RT;
   *  -  #m_cpss_R;
   *  -  #m_gss_RT;
   *  -  #m_sss_R;
   *  -  #m_Vss
   *
   *  The virtual function #_updateStandardStateThermo() is supplied to do this
   *  and must be reimplemented in child routines, when  #m_useTmpStandardStateStorage is true.
   *  It may be optionally reimplemented in child routines if
   *  #m_useTmpStandardStateStorage is false.
   *  #_updateStandardStateThermo() is called whenever a standard state property is needed.
   *
   *  This class is usually used for nearly incompressible phases. For those phases, it
   *  makes sense to change the equation of state independent variable from density to pressure.
   *
   * @todo
   *   Put some teeth into this level by overloading the setDensity() function. It should
   *   now throw an exception. Instead, setPressure routines should calculate the
   *   solution density and then call State:setDensity() directly.
