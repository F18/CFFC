 *  The reference is W. Wagner, A. Prub, "The IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Themodynamic
 *  Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use,"
 *  J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Dat, 31, 387, 2002.
 *
 * This class provides a very complicated polynomial for the specific helmholtz free
 * energy of water, as a function of temperature and density.
 *
 *    \f[
 *        \frac{M\hat{f}(\rho,T)}{R T} = \phi(\delta, \tau) =
 *                        \phi^o(\delta, \tau) +  \phi^r(\delta, \tau)
 *    \f]
 *
 *  where
 *
 *    \f[
 *         \delta = \rho / \rho_c \mbox{\qquad and \qquad} \tau = T_c / T 
 *    \f]
 *
 *  The following constants are assumed
 *
 *     \f[
 *         T_c = 647.096\mbox{\ K}
 *    \f]
 *    \f[
 *        \rho_c = 322 \mbox{\  kg\ m$^{-3}$}
 *     \f]
 *    \f[
 *        R/M = 0.46151805 \mbox{\ kJ\ kg$^{-1}$\ K$^{-1}$}
 *    \f]
 *
 *  The free energy is a unique single-valued function of the temperature and density
 *  over its entire range.
 *
 * Note, the base thermodynamic state for this class is the one
 * used in the steam tables, i.e., the liquid at the triple point
 * for water has the following properties:
 *
 * -  u(273.16, rho)    = 0.0
 * -  s(273.16, rho)    = 0.0 
 * -  psat(273.16)      = 611.655 Pascal
 * -  rho(273.16, psat) = 999.793 kg m-3
 *
 *  Therefore, to use this class within %Cantera, offsets to u() and s() must be used
 *  to put the water class onto the same basis as other thermodynamic quantities.
 *  For example, in the WaterSSTP class, these offsets are calculated in the following way.
 *  The thermodynamic base state for water is set to the NIST basis here
 *  by specifying constants EW_Offset and SW_Offset. These offsets are
 *  calculated on the fly so that the following properties hold:
 *
 *   - Delta_Hfo_idealGas(298.15, 1bar) = -241.826 kJ/gmol
 *   - So_idealGas(298.15, 1bar)        = 188.835 J/gmolK
 *
 *   The offsets are calculated by actually computing the above quantities and then
 *   calculating the correction factor.
 *
 *  This class provides an interface to the #WaterPropsIAPWSphi class, which actually
 *  calculates the \f$ \phi^o(\delta, \tau)  \f$ and the  \f$ \phi^r(\delta, \tau) \f$
 *  polynomials in dimensionless form.
 *
 *  All thermodynamic results from this class are returned in dimensional form. This 
 *  is because the gas constant (and molecular weight) used within this class is allowed to be potentially
 *  different than that used elsewhere in %Cantera. Therefore, everything has to be
 *  in dimensional units. Note, however, the thermodynamic basis is set to that used
 *  in the steam tables. (u = s = 0 for liquid water at the triple point).
 *
 *  This class is not a %ThermoPhase. However, it does maintain an internal state of
 *  the object that is dependent on temperature and density. The internal state
 *  is characterized by an internally storred \f$ \tau\f$ and a \f$ \delta \f$ value,
 *  and an iState value, which indicates whether the point is a liquid, a gas,
 *  or a supercritical fluid.
 *  Along with that the  \f$ \tau\f$ and a \f$ \delta \f$ values are polynomials of
 *  \f$ \tau\f$ and a \f$ \delta \f$ that are kept by the #WaterPropsIAPWSphi class.
 *  Therefore, whenever  \f$ \tau\f$ or \f$ \delta \f$ is changed, the function setState()
 *  must be called in order for the internal state to be kept up to date. 
 *
 * The class is pretty straightfoward. However, one function deserves mention.
 * the #density() function calculates the density that is consistent with
 * a particular value of the temperature and pressure. It may therefore be 
 * multivalued or potentially there may be no answer from this function. It therefore
 * takes a phase guess and a density guess as optional parameters. If no guesses are
 * supplied to density(), a gas phase guess is assumed. This may or may not be what
 * is wanted. Therefore, density() should usually at leat be supplied with a phase
 * guess so that it may manufacture an appropriate density guess. 
 * #density() manufactures the initial density guess, nondimensionalizes everything,
 * and then calls #WaterPropsIAPWSphi::dfind(), which does the iterative calculation
 * to find the density condition that matches the desired input pressure.
 *
 * The phase guess defines are located in the .h file. they are
