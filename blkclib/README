=================================================================
To compile the blkc library
=================================================================

  ./configure [options]
  make [target]

The arguments in [] are optional, and if given should be specified
without the [].

The recognized options to configure are:

--enable-debug
  This enables a debug version of the library. Normally, this just sets the
  -g option for compiling.

--enable-hashmap
  This enables use of a hash map instead of the map in the C++ standard library.
  Edit file "/src/hash_map to specify the hash map.  The file is configured to
  use the gnu cxx hash map by default.  Note that using a hash map probably
  will not make much difference.  Also, it has not been tested much.

--prefix=PREFIX
  This sets the installation directory for the blkc library and headers.  By
  default, PREFIX is set to /usr/local and the library will be installed as:
    /usr/local/lib/libblkc.a
  and the headers as:
    /usr/local/include/block_connectivity.h
    /usr/local/include/transform_matrix.h
  Use absolute paths or shell environment variables when specifying a directory,
  since the 'configure' is interpreted by 'sh' not 'csh'. i.e: use
  --prefix=$HOME instead of --prefix=~ .

The configure script creates the file make.defs which may be further edited
to customize the makefile settings.

Options have been explicitly set for the following systems and compilers:
  *       - gxx
  alpha   - cxx
  itanium - icpc

For a description of configuration options, type

./configure --help

The available make targets are:

all
  This is the default target (if target is not given). This builds the blkc
  library 'lib/libblkc.a' and installs '/include/block_connectivity.h' and
  '/include/transform_matrix.h'.

clean
  This removes all object files.  The library and headers in '/include' are not
  affected

distclean
  Removes the object files, library, headers in '/include' and files generated
  by 'configure'

install
  Installs the library and headers

uninstall
  Uninstalls the library and headers

depend
  Builds dependencies for the libary.  This is only useful if you are modifying
  the library.

check
  Runs a program to check the functioning of the library.

dist
  Performs a distclean and then builds the tar file 'blkc.tar.bz2' in the parent
  directory.  This is only useful if you are modifying the library.
