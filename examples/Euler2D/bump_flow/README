Bump Channel Flow:
------------------

Standard inviscid flow test case.  The initial mesh consists of eight
solution blocks -- four in the x-direction and two in the y-direction.
The bump is the south boundary of the second block and can be set as a
smooth or non-smooth bump.

The non-smooth bump is an arc of a circle with radius of 2.997190476 m 
centred at (x,y) = (0.5 m,-2.955190476 m).  This is the test case used
by Lynn [1], Tsang [2], and Li [3] in their theses.

The smooth bump is specified by 0.042 sin^2(pi x) where 0 <= x <= 1.
This is the test case used by Darmofal and Van Leer [4].  The smooth
bump removes the discontinuity in the geometry.
