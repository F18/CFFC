Crossing Particle Jets:
-----------------------

Particle-phase test case of two particle jets impinging at a 90 degree
angle [1].  The single velocity formulation does not allow for the 
crossing of particle jets that are occur in disperse concentrations
and instead results in a single jet who's velocity is the average of
the two incident jets.  This is an unphysical solution.  The multi-
velocity formulation allows for the crossing of the particle jets. 
Note that higher-order solution of the single-velocity formulation
suffers from a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.  Note this is purely a
numerical artifact.  The single-velocity formulation here was 
proposed by Saurel et al. [2].  The multi-velocity formulation is 
explained by Sachdev et al. [3].
